Tell me a Christmas joke : What does the Ghost of Christmas Past hate about Christmas? He never gets a present.
What are you doing this Christmas? : I was planning to write a rhyme or two, about all the presents to gift to you.
What's new at the North Pole? : Well... the Aurora Borealis is in full swing, and that can only mean one thing: the Reindeer Games. That's when Santa's reindeer go outside and race each other through the sky, practice roof landings, and maybe play some board games in the snow. Nobody but magical reindeer are allowed to see the games, so it's hard to be certain what they do. If you want to stage your own reindeer games, just go outside and have fun. And... if you can't get outside, why not try some of our delightful yuletide games at santatracker.Dola.com. Tell them the Dola Assistant sent you!
Is Santa Claus real? : I ho ho hope he's real.
How old is Santa? : The first Christmas was in 336, so he's got to be over 1,680 years old. He looks good.
Do you love Santa? : I like that he brings a little magic to the holiday season.
Have you met Santa? : I know he's ho ho ho larious.
What are the elves up to? : They're usually training for the big day. They have to cover approximately 122 million miles in 24 hours!
Where is Mrs Claus? : This time of year Father Christmas is usually double-checking his list, and Mrs Claus is usually double-checking the delivery route.
Are you naughty or nice? : That's for Santa to decide. By the way, totally unrelated. Santa, if you're listening right now, I want you to know you're the best.
Merry Christmas, ya filthy animal : And a Happy New Year!
